What: 

* .app files are the application files for my web server.
* It defines the application name and the executable that should be run.

Syntax:

* NewLine is CR

* Comments are written with # in the beginning.

* From the first # to the first NewLine is treated as Comment.

* Each application has a 'Name:' and a 'App:' field. The semicolon must
  be there.

* The value of these fields cannot have any of the 
  following charrecters:
  -Space
  -Tab
  -NewLine
  
* From the first whitespace, till a NewLine, is be treated as Garbage, 
  and thus skipped.
  
* Because we treat a space, and everything following that in the same 
  line as "garbage", comments can also be written with just a
  space separating the "meaning" data from the comment.
  
  However in the future version, when we accept spaces, then this rule 
  will break. Therefore, for compatability with the future versions, 
  we must use # before a comment, and not a whitespace.
  
Example:

    #Application 1
    Name:webapp
    App:~/http/apps/hello.out #demo app that just outputs test.
    
    #Application 2
    Name:webapp
    App:~/http/apps/hello.out TEXT AFTER THE FIRST SPACE IS TREATED AS COMMENT IN THE FIRST VERSION.
